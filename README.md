# TabTwin

Real-time browser tab collaboration with ghost cursors, annotations, and an AI agent that can act inside the host's Chrome tabs.

## Why TabTwin Exists

Screen sharing lets teammates watch, but it does not let them naturally point, highlight, annotate, or help operate the browser. TabTwin lets a guest or AI agent appear inside the host's real browser tab as a live ghost collaborator while the host stays in control.

## For Hosts

Hosts install the Chrome extension, start a session, share the generated link, and can revoke control at any time. The extension injects the cursor and annotation overlay, manages WebRTC signaling, and executes approved actions.

## For Guests

Guests open the session link in any modern browser. There is nothing to install. They enter a name, join the session, move a ghost cursor, annotate, highlight, scroll, and request click/type actions when the host grants permission.

## Guest Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Guest support | Install required |
| ------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Chrome  | Yes           | No               |
| Firefox | Yes           | No               |
| Edge    | Yes           | No               |
| Safari  | Yes           | No               |

## How It Works

- The Chrome extension starts a host session and injects cursor, annotation, and action scripts into tabs.
- The server handles REST session creation plus WebSocket signaling for WebRTC, cursor events, actions, and Yjs-style updates.
- The guest web app joins by link and sends cursor/actions over WebRTC data channels with WebSocket fallback.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itzzavdhesh/TabTwin.git
cd TabTwin
npm install
```

2. Run the signaling server.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm run server
```

3. Run the guest web app.

```bash
npm run dev:web
```

4. Load the unpacked extension in Chrome from the `extension/` folder.

## Host Setup

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable Developer mode.
3. Click Load unpacked.
4. Select the `extension/` folder.
5. Pin TabTwin, open the popup, and click Start Session.

## Guest Setup

Open the link the host shares. That is it.

## Session Recording and Playback

The participant currently viewing the guest session page can opt in to session recording from the session UI. When enabled, the guest-side session captures a lightweight timeline of collaboration events that stays isolated from the live WebRTC/WebSocket transport. The current recorder captures session lifecycle events, cursor movement, scroll events, annotation additions, click requests, and typing approvals.

Playback is available in the session UI once a recording has been collected. The current implementation supports play, pause, resume, seek, and timeline review for the captured events. The recording timeline is held in memory for the active session and is exposed through the existing session UI; it is not currently persisted to disk or exported as a standalone file.

## Environment Variables

| Variable            | Required                                                 | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional for local fallback, required for Claude actions | Claude API key used by the AI agent.                                                 |
| `PORT`              | No                                                       | Server port. Defaults to `3001`.                                                     |
| `CLIENT_URL`        | No                                                       | Web app origin used when generating join links. Defaults to `http://localhost:5173`. |
| `REDIS_URL`         | **Yes**                                                  | ioredis connection URL for session storage. Example: `redis://localhost:6379`.       |

## Redis

TabTwin stores session state in Redis so sessions survive server restarts and the server can scale horizontally. You must have a Redis instance running before starting the server.

**Local development (Docker)**

```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name tabtwin-redis redis:7-alpine
```

Then add the following to your `.env` file (already present in `.env.example`):

```env
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

If `REDIS_URL` is not set the server will exit immediately with a clear error message telling you what to do.

## Browser Compatibility Notice

The host extension is Chrome-only for the MVP because it depends on Chrome Manifest V3 extension APIs. Guests can join from Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari through the web app.
